# 🏗 Konnotation Internal Libraries

Welcome to the **central hub** for MyCompany’s internal reusable libraries!  
This repository is **public** for discoverability, but the actual libraries are private.  

Below you’ll find links to the core private repositories used across all projects:

| Library | Description | Access |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [next-sanity-components](https://github.com/Konnotationcph/next-sanity-components) | Reusable **Next.js frontend components** for Sanity-driven projects (Hero, SubHero, CTA, Page Renderer, etc.) | Private: org members only |
| [next-sanity-schemas](https://github.com/Konnotationcph/next-sanity-schemas) | **Sanity schemas, GROQ fetch utilities, and CMS helpers** for consistent content management | Private: org members only |

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or fork the private library repos (you need org access).  
2. Copy the components and schemas into your new project.  
3. Start building plug-and-play websites using our reusable components and Sanity schemas.
